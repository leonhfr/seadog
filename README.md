# Seadog

Seadog helps you generate statistical data visualizations directly from the command line. 

It aims to allow quick analyses of data, and while it is essentially a wrapper for [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) and [seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn), it does not intend to cover all options and capabilities. 

The word seadog may be slang for either a veteran sailor or seals. 

Seadog supports Python 3.7+.

## Installation

Seadog is [published on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/seadog/), use `pip` to install it:

```bash
pip install --user seadog
```
